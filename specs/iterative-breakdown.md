## 2. Iterative Breakdown into Chunks

We will break the project into iterative chunks that build on each other:

### **Iteration 1: Project Setup & Environment**

- **Step 1:** Set up the project repository and basic directory structure.
- **Step 2:** Create the manifest file (`manifest.json`) with required permissions and browser targets.
- **Step 3:** Add webextension-polyfill and configure a basic build/serve process (if needed).

### **Iteration 2: Basic Popup & UI Framework**

- **Step 4:** Develop the minimal HTML/CSS/JS for the popup.
- **Step 5:** Create a basic UI that opens when the extension icon is clicked.
- **Step 6:** Wire up a simple event (e.g., clicking a “Save” button) that logs dummy data.

### **Iteration 3: Core Link Saving Functionality**

- **Step 7:** Implement capturing the current page’s URL and title using the active tab API.
- **Step 8:** Extend the popup UI to include an input for the note (and optionally tags).
- **Step 9:** Save the link data (URL, title, note, timestamp) to local storage.
- **Step 10:** Integrate duplicate detection logic to check if a link exists and prompt to update.

### **Iteration 4: Categorization & Organization**

- **Step 11:** Create the UI elements for managing categories (create, update, assign colors/icons).
- **Step 12:** Allow links to be assigned to one or more categories.
- **Step 13:** Display the saved links in categorized sections within the popup.
- **Step 14:** Ensure that the UI updates correctly when links or categories are added/edited.

### **Iteration 5: Reminder System Implementation**

- **Step 15:** Define reminder conditions (e.g., link not opened within 7 days).
- **Step 16:** Add logic to flag overdue links and update the UI (visual badges, “Needs Attention” section).
- **Step 17:** (Optional) Implement a browser badge indicator for pending reminders.

### **Iteration 6: Cold Storage (Auto-Archiving) Features**

- **Step 18:** Implement auto-archiving logic based on a configurable timeframe (default: 30 days).
- **Step 19:** Exclude specific categories (like “Pinned”) from auto-archiving.
- **Step 20:** Notify the user before archiving and provide a view to access archived links.
- **Step 21:** Provide a method to restore archived links back into active view.

### **Iteration 7: Deletion & Undo System**

- **Step 22:** Implement soft deletion (remove link from a category) and full deletion (move to Trash).
- **Step 23:** Create a Trash view with options to restore or permanently delete links.
- **Step 24:** Add an undo feature that appears after deletion or significant actions (15-second window).

### **Iteration 8: Backup & Data Export**

- **Step 25:** Implement a local backup functionality that creates a backup file.
- **Step 26:** Add JSON import/export to allow data recovery or transfer.
- **Step 27:** Integrate backup functionality into the settings and provide user feedback.

### **Iteration 9: Integration & Testing**

- **Step 28:** Wire all components together ensuring consistent state and data flow.
- **Step 29:** Implement error handling for storage, network (if applicable), and user input.
- **Step 30:** Set up unit tests for core functionalities and integration tests for user workflows.
- **Step 31:** Perform cross-browser testing using webextension-polyfill to ensure compatibility.
